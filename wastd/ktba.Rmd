# Known to be alive
The following example demonstrates how data from the WAStD API can be extracted
and manipulated easily into a format suitable for KTBA analyses, e.g. through
the program MARK.

First, Animal Encounters are extracted in CSV format from their
[API endpoint](https://strandings.dpaw.wa.gov.au/api/1/animal-encounters/).

Note, this API endpoint is currently restricted to the Dept Parks & Wildlife's intranet.

## Reading the data from the WAStD API
```{r, message=F}
require(dplyr)
require(tidyr)
require(lubridate)
require(ggplot2)
require(DT)

d <- read.csv("https://strandings.dpaw.wa.gov.au/api/1/animal-encounters/?format=csv", as.is=T)
# d <- read.csv("path/to/download.csv", as.is=T)
```

TODO: show how to filter to a nesting population

## Inspecting the data
As turtles may have different nesting seasons, let's inspect the data visually
to decide where to put the season cutoff date.

```{r}
daily <- d %>%
  filter(!(name=="")) %>%
  mutate(week=isoweek(as.Date(when))) %>%
  group_by(week) %>%
  tally(sort=T)

ggplot(daily, aes(x=week)) +
  stat_bin(binwidth=1, position="identity") +
  ggtitle("Weekly Animal Encounter Tally")
```

In this example, we use the fiscal year (starting July 1, isoweek 28) as a season proxy.
However, winter nesters (like Flatbacks at Cape Dommett) might need to follow
a different seasonality, e.g. the calendar year.

## Pivoting the data into MARK format
Once we have decided on a season cutoff date, the data are:

* cast into a highly performant data type (data table tbl);
* filtered so that anonymous animals (without a tag history) are excluded;
* allocated to seasons starting July 1 and ending June 30, which will work for
  all turtles courteous enough not to nest in winter, especially not across June/July;
* pivoted into a name (rows) by season (columns) table of encounter tallies (number
  of encounters in that season).

```{r}
data <- tbl_df(d) %>%
  filter(!(name=="")) %>%
  mutate(
    when=parse_date_time(when, orders=c("ymdHMSz")),
    season=ifelse(isoweek(when) > 27, year(when), year(when)-1)
  ) %>%
  group_by(name, season) %>%
  tally(sort=T) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  spread(season, n, fill=0)
DT::datatable(data)
```

The data can now be saved to CSV for later use in MARK, or piped into RMARK, or
inspected here.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
write.csv(data, file = "data/turtle_ktba.csv", row.names=F)
```


Further steps:

* Transform the tally (potentially several encounters with the same animal
  within one season) into a binary absence/presence indicator.
* Display years with missing encounters.
