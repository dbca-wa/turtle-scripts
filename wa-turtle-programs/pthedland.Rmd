# Data
Data are loaded from DBCA's web portal for threatened species and communities [TSC](https://tsc.dbca.wa.gov.au/).
The portal is accessible to DBCA staff.

```{r load_data}
load_saved_data_tsc()

tracks_pth <- tracks_all %>% 
  filter_pth() %>% 
  exclude_training_species()%>% 
  add_nest_labels()

tracks_pth_cem <- tracks_pth %>% filter_pth_cemetery()
tracks_pth_ppo <- tracks_pth %>% filter_pth_prettypool()
surveys_pth <- surveys %>% filter_pth()
surveys_pth_prod <- surveys_pth %>% exclude_training_surveys()
surveys_pth_cem <- surveys_pth_prod %>% filter_pth_cemetery()
surveys_pth_ppo <- surveys_pth_prod %>% filter_pth_prettypool()
dist_pth <- disturbance %>% filter_pth()
nests_pth <- nests_all %>% filter_pth()

prefix_pth <- "CFH"
placename_pth <- "Port Hedland"
```

# QA
Most QA is done across all WA records and programs in the separate QA workbook.

This section identifies data likely to require editing.


```{r}
# Today was our final day of monitoring (yay!) so I've uploaded the last of the forms for you. One thing I need you to change is the latest record of a laid nest. Sam recorded this on the 25th Feb and I tried to delete it from the tablet this morning but it wouldn't let me so I think the date has changed to this morning at 7:06am. There is absolutely no new adult nest and I don't know why the volunteer thought this was the case. So please erase that record and we'll stick with our final nest being on the 17th Feb!
```


## Species
Although species other than Flatbacks are not expected to nest at Pt. Hedland's beaches,
they are still reported.

Suggested methodology for "tracks doesn't look like Flatback":

* Select "Turtle, species unknown" to unlock the "track photo" screen.
* Take photos of tracks as directed; remember to include the marked ruler as lenth reference.
* Swipe back, set species to most likely species. This will hide (but keep) the track photo screen.
* Finish form as per usual.

This helps us to QA species and also builds a library of "tricky tracks".

## Username mismatches
The data import algorithm parses hand-written usernames into known
[WAStD users](https://tsc.dbca.wa.gov.au/admin/users/user/) - the following records are flagged
for a review of the name matching.

```{r name_mismatch}
surveys_pth %>% filter_surveys_requiring_qa() %>% dt()
```

# Season summary

## General notes
Nests without a clearly visible emergence point were not recorded.
This led to under-reporting of hatched nests this season. TODO: clarify - season 2018-18 only or ongoing?

## Maps
Maps are shown for each season, with and without clustering.
Clustered tracks expand to allow accessing each popup (containing a link to update the record), while
non-clustered tracks represent the location more accurately.

Clustered maps have to be set to "Place names" to allow clusters to expand. The aerial background
imagery does not exist yet for the required zoom level.

### Nesting at Cemetery Beach 
#### 2017-18
```{r map_cem_2017}
tracks_pth_cem %>% filter_2017() %>% map_tracks(cluster=T)
tracks_pth_cem %>% filter_2017() %>% map_tracks()
```

#### 2018-19
```{r map_cem_2018}
tracks_pth_cem %>% filter_2018() %>% map_tracks(cluster=T)
tracks_pth_cem %>% filter_2018() %>% map_tracks()
```

### Nesting at Pretty Pool Beach

#### 2017-18
```{r map_ppo_2017}
tracks_pth_ppo %>% filter_2017() %>% map_tracks(cluster=T)
tracks_pth_ppo %>% filter_2017() %>% map_tracks()
```

#### 2018-19
```{r map_ppo_2018}
tracks_pth_ppo %>% filter_2018() %>% map_tracks(cluster=T)
tracks_pth_ppo %>% filter_2018() %>% map_tracks()
```

### Animated map
A [Google API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start?csw=1) must
be present as R environment variable `GOOGLE_MAPS_APIKEY` for the next step.

```{r map_animated, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
gganimate_tracks(tracks_pth, placename_pth, prefix_pth)
```

### Tagged nests
QA: every single nest tag needs to be reviewed for spelling and format, then marked as "proofread".
TSC links for DBCA curators:

* [Cemetery Beach Tagged Nests](https://tsc.dbca.wa.gov.au/admin/observations/nesttagobservation/?encounter__site__id__exact=35)
* [Pretty Pool Beach Tagged Nests](https://tsc.dbca.wa.gov.au/admin/observations/nesttagobservation/?encounter__site__id__exact=45)

#### 2017-18
No tagged nests recorded digitally.

TODO insert season summary from data sheets.

#### 2018-19
This map shows the locations of all encounters with tagged nests. This includes newly tagged nests
and re-sighted, already tagged nests.
The nests shown here are a subset of the total numbers shown above. Newly tagged nests are shown above
as "tracks with nests / successful crawls", re-sighted tagged nests are shown above as either "nest"
or "hatched nest".

Multiple sightings of the same nest are possible and will appear as separate markers on the map.

Maps are split by site and clustering.

```{r tagged_nests_2018}
nests_pth %>% 
  filter_2018() %>%
  map_nests(cluster=TRUE)

nests_pth %>% 
  filter_2018() %>%
  filter_pth_cemetery() %>% 
  map_nests(cluster=FALSE)

nests_pth %>% 
  filter_2018() %>%
  filter_pth_prettypool() %>% 
  map_nests(cluster=FALSE)
```

```{r nest_tags_distinct_2018}
distinct_nest_tags_cem <- nests_pth %>% 
  filter_2018() %>% 
  filter_pth_cemetery() %>% 
  group_by(date_nest_laid, flipper_tag_id, tag_label) %>% 
  tally()

distinct_nest_tags_ppo <- nests_pth %>% 
  filter_2018() %>% 
  filter_pth_prettypool() %>% 
  group_by(date_nest_laid, flipper_tag_id, tag_label) %>% 
  tally()
```

The records show `r distinct_nest_tags_cem %>% nrow` distinct nest tags at Cemetery Beach and
`r distinct_nest_tags_ppo %>% nrow` on Pretty Pool Beach.

##### Individual nest tag observations
```{r nest_tags_sightings}
nests_pth %>% dt
```

## Nesting abundance

### All beaches

tracks_pth_cem %>% nesting_type_by_season_species() %>% kable()
```

### Pretty Pool Beach
```{r tracks_ppo}
tracks_pth_ppo %>% nesting_type_by_season_species() %>% kable()
```


## Nesting by week
### All beaches
The next table includes all tracks from all sites combined.

```{r tracks_all_beaches_by_week}
tracks_pth %>% nesting_type_by_season_week_species() %>% kable()
```

### Cemetery Beach

tracks_pth_cem %>% nesting_type_by_season_week_species() %>% kable()
```

### Pretty Pool Beach
```{r nesting_ppo}
tracks_pth_ppo %>% nesting_type_by_season_week_species() %>% kable()
```

## Nesting by day
Figures: All sites, Cemetery Beach, Pretty Pool Beach.

Points: number of tracks / nests, bars: number of surveys. Resolution: one day. Date shown is turtle date.
```{r nesting_success, warning = F}
tracks_ts(tracks_pth, surveys_pth_prod, placename_pth, prefix_pth)
tracks_ts(tracks_pth_cem, surveys_pth_cem, "Cemetery Beach", prefix_pth)
tracks_ts(tracks_pth_ppo, surveys_pth_ppo, "Pretty Pool Beach", prefix_pth)

nests <- tracks_pth %>% track_success()

nests %>% ggplot_track_success_by_date("natator-depressus", placename_pth, prefix_pth)
nests %>% ggplot_track_successrate_by_date("natator-depressus", placename_pth, prefix_pth)
nests %>% track_success_by_species() %>% DT::datatable(.,
  caption = "Nesting success of fresh tracks (excl. nests without tracks and tagging)"
)
```

## Hatching and emergence success
```{r hatching_emergence_success}
tracks_pth %>% hatching_emergence_success() %>% dt0
```

## Disturbance and predation
Disturbed nests are captured through form "Track or Treat" and appear here
as "tracks" with "disturbance" recorded as "present".

General signs of disturbance or predator presence are recorded through form 
"Fox Sake" and appear here as "dist_(place)".

### Disturbance and predation of nests
Turtle nests with recorded disturbance or predation.

#### 2017-18
```{r dist_nests_2017}
disturbed_nests_pth_2017 <- tracks_pth %>% filter_2017() %>% filter(disturbance == "present")
disturbed_nests_pth_2017 %>% map_tracks()
```

#### 2018-19
```{r dist_nests_2018}
disturbed_nests_pth_2018 <- tracks_pth %>% filter_2018() %>% filter(disturbance == "present")
disturbed_nests_pth_2018 %>% map_tracks()
```

There were **`r count(disturbed_nests_pth_2017)` reports** of disturbed nests in 2017-18
and **`r count(disturbed_nests_pth_2018)` reports** in 2018-19. 
Caveat: QA to exclude possible training records.

Coming soon: details of disturbance to nests.

### General disturbance

#### 2017
```{r map_dist_2017}
dist_pth_2017 <- dist_pth %>% filter_2017() 
dist_pth_2017 %>% group_by(disturbance_cause) %>% tally %>% arrange(-n) %>% kable()
dist_pth_2017 %>% map_dist()
```

#### 2018
None yet.
```{r map_dist_2018}
dist_pth_2018 <- dist_pth %>% filter_2018 
dist_pth_2018 %>% group_by(disturbance_cause) %>% tally %>% arrange(-n) %>% kable
dist_pth_2018 %>% map_dist
```

There were **`r count(dist_pth_2017)` reports** of general disturbance or predator presence in 2017-18
and **`r count(dist_pth_2018)` reports** in 2018-19.

## Surveys
Curators are to QA 
[all local surveys on WAStD](https://tsc.dbca.wa.gov.au/admin/observations/survey/?site__id__in=35,45) 
following the 
[QA instructions for surveys](https://wastd.readthedocs.io/data_curators.html#data-flow-of-surveys).

Split up per site:

* [Cemetery Beach](https://tsc.dbca.wa.gov.au/admin/observations/survey/?site__id__exact=35)
* [Pretty Pool Beach](https://tsc.dbca.wa.gov.au/admin/observations/survey/?site__id__exact=45)

### Caveat 
* Survey data includes training surveys. (Not production, but also effort)
* Surveys with missing end points are auto-closed after 0.5 hours.
* Data excludes commute to survey site.

### Dates
* Season 2018-19: From 30/10/2018 to 28/02/2019, CEM is surveyed daily, PPO Mon/Wed/Fri.
  Some real surveys prior to 30/10/2018.
* First nesting of season 2018-19 was observed on 25/09/2018.

### Per season effort
Highest level of aggregation: entire season.
Assumption: all training surveys have been marked as such in WAStD.

#### Including training

```{r survey_season_stats_all}
surveys_pth %>% survey_season_stats %>% dt
```

#### Excluding training

```{r survey_season_stats_prod}
surveys_pth_prod %>% survey_season_stats %>% dt
```

### Per day effort
Lowest level of aggregation: daily.

```{r survey_count}
surveys_pth %>% survey_count_heatmap(placename_pth, prefix_pth)
surveys_pth %>% list_survey_count(placename_pth)
surveys_pth %>% survey_hours_heatmap(placename_pth, prefix_pth)
surveys_pth %>% list_survey_effort(placename_pth)
```

### Individual surveys
No aggregation: individual surveys.

```{r surveys_list}
surveys_pth %>% survey_show_detail %>% dt()
```


## Volunteer effort
* Surveys including training runs represent volunteer effort.

### Going digital
Entering and proofreading a record takes about 2 minutes with full concentration.
By going digital, data entry and proofreading are fully automated.
Overall, the Volunteers have saved 
`r round((nrow(tracks_pth) + nrow(surveys_pth)*2 + nrow(dist_pth)) * 2 / 60)` 
hours of mind-numbing data entry and proofreading work for 
`r nrow(tracks_pth)` Tracks, 
`r nrow(dist_pth)` Disturbances, and 
`r nrow(surveys_pth)*2` Site Visit Starts/Ends. 

#### 2017-18
* There were **`r surveys_pth %>% filter_2017() %>% nrow` surveys** 
  including training for a total duration of 
  **`r sum(filter_2017(surveys_pth_prod)$duration_hours)` hours**.
* At Cemetery Beach, **`r survey_ground_covered(surveys, 35, 1.6, 2017)` km** were walked 
  in **`r survey_count(surveys_pth, 35, 2017)`** surveys.
* At Pretty Pool Beach, **`r survey_ground_covered(surveys, 45, 1.8, 2017)` km** were walked 
  in **`r survey_count(surveys_pth, 45, 2017)`** surveys.

#### 2018-19
* There were **`r surveys_pth %>% filter_2018() %>% nrow` surveys** 
  including training for a total duration of 
  **`r sum(filter_2018(surveys_pth_prod)$duration_hours) %>% round()` hours**.
* At Cemetery Beach, **`r survey_ground_covered(surveys, 35, 1.6, 2018)` km** were walked 
  in **`r survey_count(surveys_pth, 35, 2018)`** surveys.
* At Pretty Pool Beach, **`r survey_ground_covered(surveys, 45, 1.8, 2018)` km** were walked 
  in **`r survey_count(surveys_pth, 45, 2018)`** surveys.

### Per person
The following list only includes the primary reporter. 
This leads to under-reporting of time spent by other volunteers attending the survey.
Their names are listed in the Site Visit Start form field "comments" as free text
(surveys > start_comments), and from 2018, in the Site Visit Start form field "team".

To correctly report on team member effort, curators have to read the list of 
team members in the Survey "start_comments" field and attach the correct users 
to the Survey's team list. From 2018, this will be automated but still requires QA.

Once the surveys are comprehensively attributed to all volunteers present, the code underneath this
workbook has to be updated to include the Survey team's effort.

If the primary reporter forgot to update the username in the tablet,
their survey effort on that day is incorrectly attributed to the previous reporter.
The only way to reconcile attribution is to manually compare survey usernames with team rosters.

#### 2017-18
```{r survey_effort_by_person_2017}
surveys_pth %>% filter_2017() %>% survey_hours_per_person() %>% kable()
```

#### 2018-19
```{r survey_effort_by_person_2018}
surveys_pth %>% filter_2018() %>% survey_hours_per_person() %>% kable()
```

# Data upload

## Raw data
* Raw data are exported into CSV spreadsheets.
* Key figures are exported into .png raster files.
* This report is rendered into a single HTML page.

## Google Drive
A copy of this report and all generated outputs is uploaded to Google Drive
and shared via link with DBCA external collaborators.

Every machine has to be authenticated with Google Drive once.
As this process involves browser windows and pasting of approval codes into the 
R Console, it is not run automatically when compiling this workbook.

Running the following chunk manually once per machine will cache the authentication
token locally for future use.

```{r google_drive_auth, eval=F}
googledrive::drive_auth(reset=TRUE, use_oob = TRUE)
```

```{r google_drive_upload}
googledrive::drive_ls(prefix_pth) %>% googledrive::drive_rm(.)
