# Background
## The history of turtle monitoring at Thevenard and Delambre Islands
TBA

## Scope of works and objectives

# Methodology
## Location
TODO Location and site description.

TODO Map with monitored area highlighted (tagging, nest census) and labels.

## Turtle Nesting Census methods
The methodology, data collection protocols and hardware setup are described in detail in the [WAStD Manual](https://dbca-wa.github.io/wastd/index.html#document-data_collection/data_collection_training).

## Survey effort
TODO linear  “calendar” with one box per day and colour one colour for tagging, one colour for morning surveys, one colour for marking nests and excavating. 
That will show start and end date of nesting season + number of days for each year +missed days

# Turtle Nesting
Replace “Turtle nesting” by “Results”
Replace “tagged animals” by “Tagging census results”
This has to be updated once the full tagging database has been imported and problems fixed

For each season:

    • show as text the total number of processed turtles and percentage of each species
Flatback turtles
Nesting abundance
TABLE:

* Total, mean, SD and range number of processed turtles
* Total, mean, SD and range number of unique individuals
* Total, mean, SD and range number of new turtles
* Total, mean, SD and range number of remigrants
* Mean, SD, range of number of missed turtles per night, and percentage of missed turtles per night (compared to number of processed turtles)
* Total, mean, SD and range number of nests (need to discuss methodology to QA data to identify nests)
* Total, mean, SD and range number of false crawls
* mean, SD and range nesting success
* hide table “animals processed per day”
* hide table “ tags processed per day”
* keep figure “Number of processed turtles per day” but add number of missed turtles per day to the figure, staked histograms
* add figure “Number of new and remigrant turtles per day” : show the number of new turtles and remigrants each day (unique sighting, not observations)
* add figure “Nesting success”: show the number of false crawls and nests each day + dashed line showing the mean

Inter-nesting interval and clutch frequency 
TABLE:

- mean, SD, range of inter-nesting interval in days + number of animals
- mean, SD, range of clutch frequency

* hide figure “nesting intervals”
* add figure “Clutch Frequency”: show estimated number of turtles that lay 1 clutch, 2 clutches, 3 clutches, etc

Remigrants

* Add figure “remigration interval”: show the number of remigrants coming back after 1,2,3, 4+ years
* Add text about remigrant turtles coming for other rookeries

Morphometric

TABLE with mean, SD, range for CCl, CCW and weight

Track census results

* Add section “Track census results”
* TABLE “nesting abundance – All beaches” – should be in this section but no need to show raw numbers
* show Total, mean, SD, range tracks per day for each species (excluding olive ridley and loggehreads)
* show successful tracks, false crawls, unsure and not assessed, remove all other categories
* show only fresh tracks
* clearly separate years as not obvious as it is
* show mean, SD, range for nesting success for flatbacks

* keep maps : “tracks and nests”
* hide “animated map”
* Table “ Nesting by week – All beaches” : hide for report but should appear on website instead during the nesting season
* Figures “nesting by day”:
* remove figure : “nesting activity” as data shown in table + difficult to read the figure
* keep figure “nesting effort”  but add dashed line to show mean nesting success. All tracks should only be false crawls + successful (remove unsure and unchecked)
* remove figure “nesting success” for all species but flatbacks

Add Heat maps under section “Nesting abundance and distribution -summary”
For Thevenard: 
heat map for the whole island combining track count, tagging data, missed turtles for both greens and flatbacks:
    
    • one map showing total number of tracks per cell
    • one map showing successful tracks per cell
For Delambre

* heat map for the whole island combining track count, tagging data, missed turtles for flatbacks:
* one map showing total number of tracks per cell
* one map showing successful tracks per cell
* Replace “Hatching and emergence success” by “Incubation success and hatchling production”
* make sure tables fit on landscape A4 format 
* keep table
* add map showing locations of hatched nests throughout the season
* add map showing location of excavated nests and their hatching success. Hatching success can be shown in categories
* add histogram showing proportion of nests in each hatching success categories

Disturbance and predation
remove text. if need add a paragraph about the methods in methodology section
clarify the difference between disturbed nests and general disturbance. does that mean tracks?
If possible both types should appear on the same map
Merge both tables 


End of TODO list.

## Tagged animals

### 2017-18
```{r}
tags_by_date <- tags_del %>% filter_2017 %>% group_by(turtle_date) %>% tally() %>% ungroup()
animals_by_date <- tags_del %>% filter_2017 %>% group_by(turtle_date, name) %>% tally() %>% ungroup()
```

A total of `r tags_del %>% filter_2017 %>% nrow()` turtles were processed (captured new or resighted)
during the `r length(unique(tags_by_date$turtle_date))` days of field work on which tagging took place.

This number excludes records in WAMTRAM with missing coordinates or time stamps. 
Re-sightings of the same turtle are counted as separate handling events.

On average, `r mean(tags_by_date$n) %>% round(digits = 2)` 
(SD `r sd(tags_by_date$n) %>% round(digits = 2)`, 
range `r min(tags_by_date$n)` to `r max(tags_by_date$n)`) turtles were processed 
per surveyed day.

`r length(unique(animals_by_date$name))` distinct tags were applied.
This number relates to new animals, but contains the tag "NA" and resightings.
This number also omits the invalid records from WAMTRAM with missing coordinates 
or dates.

### 2018-19
```{r}
tags_by_date_2018 <- tags_del %>% filter_2018 %>% group_by(turtle_date) %>% tally() %>% ungroup()
animals_by_date_2018 <- tags_del %>% filter_2018 %>% group_by(turtle_date, name) %>% tally() %>% ungroup()
```

A total of `r tags_del %>% filter_2018 %>% nrow()` turtles were processed (captured new or resighted)
during the `r length(unique(tags_by_date_2018$turtle_date))` days of field work on which tagging took place in season 2018-19.

This number excludes records in WAMTRAM with missing coordinates or time stamps. 
Re-sightings of the same turtle are counted as separate handling events.

On average, `r mean(tags_by_date_2018$n) %>% round(digits = 2)` 
(SD `r sd(tags_by_date_2018$n) %>% round(digits = 2)`, 
range `r min(tags_by_date_2018$n)` to `r max(tags_by_date_2018$n)`) turtles were processed 
per surveyed day.

`r length(unique(animals_by_date_2018$name))` distinct tags were applied.
This number relates to new animals, but contains the tag "NA" and resightings.
This number also omits the invalid records from WAMTRAM with missing coordinates 
or dates.

**TODO**

* For each tag with nesting `present`, count number of of sightings before.
* For each tag without nesting `present`, count number of sightings within 7 days 
  from each other.
* Mean number of nests per night, sd, range
* Equivalent to ~ 600 nests over 1 km of beach in 4 months
* Nesting density as number of nests per km coastline
* Per species: CCL and CCW, mean, sd, min, max

```


The chart shows encounters with the given tags over the season. Every dot is a tag (tag ID is y-axis) being applied or re-sighted at a given turtle date (x-axis).

Re-sighted tags are connected with a line.

The categories "nesting event" or not indicate whether the turtle was confirmed nesting or maybe just identified while false crawling (and tag still recorded).

There is a heap of single encounters which I didn't want to filter out as not to imply that all tags were re-sighted.

The natural progression of new tag IDs versus date reflects the tagging teams going through their sorted tag batches over the season.

The chart is immensely tall (60 inches printed) for this huge number of tags. Looking for clever ways to shrink the chart height.



**TODO** How many days elapse to first resighting? 
This section depends on new functionality of WAStD (identifying recaptures).

### 2018-19

## Maps
### Tracks and Nests 2017-18

```{r map_del_2017}
tracks_del %>% filter_2017() %>% map_tracks(sites=sites)
```

### Tracks and Nests 2018-19
Android bug with GPS accuracy introduced spread of copordinates.

```{r map_del_2018}
tracks_del %>% filter_2018() %>% map_tracks(sites=sites)
```

### Animated map
A [Google API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start?csw=1) must
be present as R environment variable `GOOGLE_MAPS_APIKEY` for the next step.

```{r map_del_animated, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# tracks_del %>% filter_2017() %>% gganimate_tracks(placename_del, prefix_del)
```

### Tagged nests 2017-18
The map is saved as a PNG file `r glue::glue(prefix_del, "_tagged_nests_YYYY.png")`.
```{r nests_del_2017}
nests_del %>%
  filter_2017() %>%
  map_nests() %T>%
  mapview::mapshot(file = glue::glue("{prefix_del}_tagged_nests_2017.png"))
```

### Tagged nests 2018-19
```{r nests_del_2018}
nests_del %>%
  filter_2018() %>%
  map_nests() %T>%
  mapview::mapshot(file = glue::glue("{prefix_del}_tagged_nests_2018.png"))
```

## Nesting abundance
### All beaches
```{r tracks_all_sectors_del}
tracks_del %>% nesting_type_by_season_species() %>% kable()
```

## Nesting by week
### All beaches
The next table show data from all sites.

```{r tracks_all_beaches_by_week_del}
tracks_del %>% nesting_type_by_season_week_species() %>% kable()
```

## Nesting by day
This section shows data from all sites.

```{r nesting_success_del, warning = F}
tracks_ts(tracks_del, surveys_del_prod, placename_del, prefix_del)
nests <- tracks_del %>% track_success()
nests %>% ggplot_track_success_by_date("natator-depressus", placename_del, prefix_del)
nests %>% ggplot_track_successrate_by_date("natator-depressus", placename_del, prefix_del)
nests %>% ggplot_track_success_by_date("chelonia-mydas", placename_del, prefix_del)
nests %>% ggplot_track_successrate_by_date("chelonia-mydas", placename_del, prefix_del)
nests %>% track_success_by_species() %>% DT::datatable(.,
  caption = "Nesting success of fresh tracks (excl. nests without tracks and tagging)"
)
```

## Hatching and emergence success
```{r hatching_emergence_success_del}
tracks_del %>%
  hatching_emergence_success() %>%
  DT::datatable(., caption = "Hatching and emergence success summary", options = list(paging = F))
```

## Disturbance and predation
Disturbed nests are captured through form "Track or Treat" and appear here
as "tracks" with "disturbance" recorded as "present".

General signs of disturbance or predator presence are recorded through form 
"Fox Sake" and appear here as "dist_(place)".

### Disturbance and predation of nests
Turtle nests with recorded disturbance or predation.

#### Disturbance 2017-18
```{r dist_nests_del_2017}
disturbed_nests_del_2017 <- tracks_del %>% filter_2017() %>% filter(disturbance == "present")
disturbed_nests_del_2017 %>% map_tracks(sites=sites)
```

#### Disturbance 2018-19
```{r dist_nests_del_2018}
disturbed_nests_del_2018 <- tracks_del %>% filter_2018() %>% filter(disturbance == "present")
disturbed_nests_del_2018 %>% map_tracks(sites=sites)
```

There were **`r count(disturbed_nests_del_2017)` reports** of disturbed nests in 2017
and **`r count(disturbed_nests_del_2018)` reports** in 2018. 
Caveat: QA to exclude possible training records.

Coming soon: details of disturbance to nests.

### General disturbance
There were **`r dist_del %>% filter_2017() %>% count()` reports** of general disturbance or predator 
presence in 2017-18 and **`r dist_del %>% filter_2018() %>% count()` reports** in 2018-19.

#### General disturbance 2017-18
```{r map_dist_del_2017}
dist_del %>% filter_2017() %>% group_by(disturbance_cause) %>% tally() %>% arrange(-n) %>% kable()
dist_del %>% filter_2017() %>% map_dist()
```

#### General disturbance 2018-19
```{r map_dist_del_2018}
dist_del %>% filter_2018() %>% group_by(disturbance_cause) %>% tally() %>% arrange(-n) %>% kable()
dist_del %>% filter_2018() %>% map_dist()
```


# Surveys
Curators are to QA 
[all `r placename_del` surveys on WAStD](https://tsc.dbca.wa.gov.au/admin/observations/survey/?site__id__exact=39)
following the 
[QA instructions for surveys](https://wastd.readthedocs.io/data_curators.html#data-flow-of-surveys).


## Going digital
Entering and proofreading a record takes about 2 minutes with full concentration.
By going digital, data entry and proofreading are fully automated.

Time savings Delambre: `r (nrow(tracks_del) + nrow(surveys_del)*2 + nrow(dist_del)) * 2 / 60` 
hours for `r nrow(tracks_del)` Track or Treats and  `r nrow(surveys_del)*2` Site Visit Starts/Ends 
over all seasons.


### Per season effort
Highest level of aggregation: entire season.
Assumption: all training surveys have been marked as such in WAStD.

#### Excluding training

```{r survey_season_stats_all}
surveys_del %>% survey_season_stats %>% dt
```

### Per day effort
Lowest level of aggregation: daily.

```{r survey_count}
surveys_del %>% survey_count_heatmap(placename_del, prefix_del)
surveys_del %>% list_survey_count(placename_del)
surveys_del %>% survey_hours_heatmap(placename_del, prefix_del)
surveys_del %>% list_survey_effort(placename_del)
```

### Individual surveys
No aggregation: individual surveys.

```{r surveys_list}
surveys_del %>% survey_show_detail %>% dt()
```

## Survey effort per primary reporter
Q Which volunteer did the most hours overall on survey?

### Caveat
This list only includes the primary reporter. 
This leads to under-reporting of time spent by other volunteers attending the survey.
Their names are listed in the Site Visit Start form field "comments" as free text.
To correctly report on team member effort, curators have to read the list of 
team members in the Site Visit "comments" field and attach the correct users 
to the Survey team list.
Once the surveys are comprehensively attributed to all volunteers present, this
workbook has to be updated to include the Survey team's effort.

If the primary reporter forgot to update the username in the tablet,
their survey effort on that day is incorrectly attributed to the previous reporter.
The only way to reconcile attribution is to manually compare survey usernames with
team rosters.

```{r survey_effort_by_person}
personal_effort_del <- surveys_del %>% survey_hours_per_person()
personal_effort_del %>% kable()
```

## Survey effort
### Season 2017-18
Number of surveys per sector times length of site.

At Delambre, assuming the trip was 4 km,
`r survey_ground_covered(surveys, 39, 4, 2017)` km were walked 
in `r survey_count(surveys, 39, 2017)` surveys.

### Season 2018-19
Number of surveys per sector times length of site.

At Delambre, assuming the trip was 4 km,
`r survey_ground_covered(surveys, 39, 4, 2018)` km were walked 
in `r survey_count(surveys, 39, 2018)` surveys.

## Surveys requiring QA
```{r name_mismatch_del}
