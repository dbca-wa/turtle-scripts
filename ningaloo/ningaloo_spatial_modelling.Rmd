as supplied by the current custodian Keely Markovina.

# Caveat
## Work in progress
Until this notice disappears, this workbook presents a work in progress without
guarantee for the validity of the created insight.
Until this notice disappears, the findings presented here must be treated as
potentially wrong, and must not be used against the intellectual owners of the
data or any related products.
(Next: follow [this example](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~ahamann/teaching/renr690/Lab9.pdf))

# Assumptions
## Absences and sampling design
###Unobserved absences
The sampling design does not cover all Ningaloo beaches comprehensively,
but rather limits observations to a manageable subset of beaches.
Therefore, absences of nest observations at any spatial location are either
false absences due to undersampling, or real absences.

###Observed absences
Assuming that beach subsections were always sampled
comprehensively by well-trained operators, zero counts of nests in surveyed
beaches are seen as real absences of nests at that particular location and time.

###Spatial patterns
PCNM analysis can only detect spatial patterns between the
sampled beaches. It is possible that, were more beaches sampled, additional,
differently shaped patterns could be found as significant drivers of nest abundance.
The patterns detected here however are real.

### Gaps in environmental variables
Over the years, different environmental variables were collected, creating gaps
in preceding surveys. These gaps are filled with `NA` values, which the analyses
we use here cannot handle. Therefore, there is little environmental data to model
with.

# Data

## Origin of data
A snapshot of the original Access database is maintained by custodian Keely Markovina
on the Ningaloo Turtle Program's [dataset](http://internal-data.dpaw.wa.gov.au/dataset/ningaloo-turtle-program-data),
then the [NTP postprocessing workbook](http://internal-data.dpaw.wa.gov.au/dataset/ningaloo-turtle-program-data/resource/1df672e2-4e42-4145-8be2-40c02a8f9319)
is run, which extracts, transforms and uploads data in accessible formats.

## Loading the data
This workbook loads the extracted and summarised data from the catalogue.
```{r}
# Online
# nests <- read.csv(ckanr::resource_show(NEW_NEST_RID)$url, as.is=T)
# sites <- read.csv(ckanr::resource_show(SITES_CSV_RID)$url, as.is=T)
# surveys <- read.csv(ckanr::resource_show(SURVEYS_RID)$url, as.is=T)

# Offline
nests <- read.csv("data/summary_nests.csv", as.is=T)
sites <- read.csv("data/sites.csv", as.is=T)
surveys <- read.csv("data/surveys.csv", as.is=T)

```

## Preparing the data
Let's use standard names for variables:

* Y.in is an initial numeric data.frame of responding variables; here:
  a survey by species matrix of nest abundance.
* X.in is an initial numeric data.frame of environmental variables; here:
  all numeric variables of survey-level environmental observations.
* Xs is a numeric data.frame of spatial lon/lat coordinates.
* Xt is a numeric data.frame of temporal timestamps (using date as continuous number).
* X.dates is a one-column data.frame of the dates as date objects, which will
  come in handy to label graph axes.

From the original summary of nest abundance, surveys with missing coordinates or
other essential data for later analysis (here: `site_disturbed`, and location names)
are excluded.

```{r}
nest <- nests %>% filter(
  !is.na(lon), !is.na(lat), !is.na(site_disturbed),
  !is.na(subsection), !is.na(section), !is.na(division)) %>% as.data.frame()
X.site.xy <- sites %>% select(lon, lat) %>% as.data.frame()
Xs <- nest %>% select(lon, lat)
Xt <- nest %>% transmute(date=as.numeric(ymd(date)))
X.dates <- nest %>% select(date)
Y.in <- nest %>% select(Flatback, Green, Loggerhead, Hawksbill, Unidentified)
X.in <- nest %>% select(no_false_crawls_fox_tracks, fox_tracks_present, dog_tracks_present,
  site_disturbed, wind_speed, wind_direction, air_temp, water_temp, height_of_high_tide)
```

# Diagnostics and data treatment
## Detect and eliminate correlated variables
* Pair plot of Y.in and X.in
* Correlated variables will form lines
* Uncorrelated variables will be uniformly distributed over both axes
```{r}
pairs(Y.in, main="Correlations between species")
pairs(X.in, main="Correlations between environmental variables")
```

* Action: exclude one of each correlated variable pairs

## Identify and treat skewness
* Histograms of Y and X will show the distribution of variable values.
* Expected: normal or uniform distribution.
* Right-skewed distributions can be log-transformed.
* Left-skewed distributions can be sqrt-transformed.
* Sparse observations should be Hellinger-transformed to reduce false similarity
  between sites through shared absence (which might be undersampling rather than
  true absence).

```{r}
yp <- ggplot(Y.in)
yp + geom_bar(aes(Loggerhead))
yp + geom_bar(aes(Green))
yp + geom_bar(aes(Flatback))
yp + geom_bar(aes(Hawksbill))
yp + geom_bar(aes(Unidentified))
summary(Y.in)
```

* Let's drop Flatbacks and Unidentified, as they are too sparse, and will bias
  the dataset with shared absences creating false similarities between beaches.
* Hellinger-transform the very left-skewed, sparse dataset.
* Possible alternative to Hellinger: `log(y) + c` transformation.

```{r}
Y.hel <- Y.in %>% select(Green, Loggerhead, Hawksbill) %>% decostand("hellinger")
yp <- ggplot(Y.hel)
yp + geom_bar(aes(Loggerhead))
yp + geom_bar(aes(Green))
yp + geom_bar(aes(Hawksbill))
```
The distributions are looking better now!

```{r}
xp <- ggplot(X.in)
xp + geom_bar(aes(no_false_crawls_fox_tracks))
xp + geom_bar(aes(wind_speed))
xp + geom_bar(aes(wind_direction))
xp + geom_bar(aes(air_temp))
xp + geom_bar(aes(water_temp))
xp + geom_bar(aes(height_of_high_tide))
summary(X.in)
```

* Variables of X.in that are all 0 carry no explanatory weight and should be excluded.
  The histograms show variables like wind_speed with lots of 0, which in the original
  data are NA. These variables need to be populated comprehensively or excluded.
* Continuous variables with different physical units (angles, velocities,
  temperatures) need to be ranged to `[0..1]`, e.g. using `scales::rescale()`.
* Binary "yes/no" variables already range from 0 to 1.

Overall, only the three binary variables are useful.

```{r}
X <- X.in %>% select(site_disturbed, fox_tracks_present, dog_tracks_present)
pairs(X)
summary(X)
```

## Remove linear spatial trends
Linear spatial trends indicate processes acting at a larger than detectable scale.
Linear trends need to be removed prior to further analysis, otherwise they will
use up the explanatory power of independent variables.

We will build a Canonical Redundancy Analysis (RDA) model of responding variables
constrained by their spatial coordinates, and work with the residuals of the model.

Our naming convention calls the data frame of filtered (rows), selected (columns),
inspected and transformed data now `Y`.
```{r}
Y <- residuals(rda(Y.hel, Xs))
pairs(Y)
```
There still seems to be a negative correlation between the abundance of Green vs.
Loggerhead turtle nests.

# Principal Coordinate Analysis of Neighbourhood Matrices
PCNM results in synthetic variables, which encode all possible spatial and temporal
patterns between sites and survey dates.

* We will calculate PCNM variables for sites (not surveys),
* join the spatial PCNM variables to the sites table,
* join the sites table to the surveys table, and
* keep only the PCNM variables for each survey.

This will result in a matrix Xs.pcnm with the same number of rows as Y.

A note on performance:
Calcualting PCNM variables is fast for only 61 sites. Joining PCNM variables of 61 sites to 12k surveys is fast.

In contrast, there's no cheat for the time stamps, so calculating PCNM variables
for 9366 surveys will take a while (~3 minutes on i7 / 8GB).
```{r}
Xs.site.pcnm <- pcnm(dist(X.site.xy))
sites_pcnm <- cbind(sites, scores(Xs.site.pcnm))
surveys_pcnm <- left_join(nest, sites_pcnm, by=c("division", "section", "subsection"))
Xs.scores <- select(surveys_pcnm, starts_with("PCNM"))

# This one's gonna hurt.
Xt.pcnm <- pcnm(dist(Xt))
Xt.scores <- as.data.frame(scores(Xt.pcnm))
```
TODO Report min and max detectable pattern size.
TODO speed up Xt.pcnm

# Variable selection and modelling
## Selecting good predictors
* Forward selection of Y, X gives X.sel
* Forward selection of Y, Xs.pcnm gives Xs.sel
* Forward selection of Y, Xt.pcnm gices Xt.sel

```{r}
Xs.sel <- forward.sel(Y, Xs.scores)
Xt.sel <- forward.sel(Y, Xt.scores)
X.sel <- forward.sel(Y, X)
XS <- Xs.scores %>% select(Xs.sel$order)
XT <- Xt.scores %>% select(Xt.sel$order)
XE <- X %>% select(X.sel$order)
```

## Jointly and separately explained variance
Variation partioning

```{r}
X.sel
Xs.sel
Xt.sel
Y.vp <- varpart(Y, ~as.matrix(XE), ~as.matrix(XS), ~as.matrix(XT))
Y.vp
plot(Y.vp)
```
This Venn diagram shows the variance of Y explained by

* environmental variables alone (X1, 0%),
* spatial patterns alone (X2, 23%),
* temporal patterns alone (X3, 5%),
* spatial and temporal patterns jointly (2%), and
* spatial and environmental patterns jointly (1%).

A residual 71% variance in Y remains unexplained by detectable spatial and temporal
patterns, and used environmental variables.

## Spatial patterns
Consider the variance explained by spatial patterns, identified through forward
variable selection.

```{r}
Xs.sel
```
PCNM3 explains 15%, PCNM8 a further 4%. Let's plot these two.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# ordisurf(x=select(sites_pcnm, lon, lat), sites_pcnm$PCNM3, bubble=3,
#      main="Spatial pattern PCNM 3 explains 15% variance")
#
# ordisurf(select(sites_pcnm, lon, lat), sites_pcnm$PCNM8, bubble=3,
#      main="Spatial pattern PCNM 8 explains 4% variance")

plot.xs <- function(nr, coords, scores, fs){
  ordisurf(coords, scores[,nr], bubble=3,
           main=paste("Spatial pattern", fs[nr,2]),
           sub=paste("explains", round(as.numeric(fs[nr,3]), digits=3)*100,
                     "% variance"))
}

lapply(seq_len(nrow(Xs.sel)),
       plot.xs,
       select(sites_pcnm, lon, lat),
       select(sites_pcnm, starts_with("PCNM")),
       Xs.sel)
```


## Temporal patterns
Note, we are considering all useable surveys of all locations mixed together.
It might be more useful to consider surveys of all times from one beach subsection only
when looking at temporal patterns.

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
#' Create a scatterplot of PCNM values against dates.
#'
#' nr: The row number of the forward.sel dataframe
#' dates: a vector of ymd dates
#' scores: a data.frame of PCNM scores
#' fs: an output data.frame of forward.sel
plot.xt <- function(nr, dates, scores, fs){
  plot(x=ymd(dates), y=scores[,nr], type="p",
     xlab="", ylab=paste("PCNM", fs[nr,2]),
     main=paste("Temporal pattern", fs[nr,2]),
     sub=paste("explains", round(as.numeric(fs[nr,3]), digits=3)*100, "% variance"))
}

# Plot all significant temporal PCNM variables.
lapply(seq_len(Xt.sel$order), plot.xt, X.dates$date, XT, Xt.sel)
```

Temporal patterns 9 (1.2% variance) and 12 (0.9% variance) coincide with the
2011/2012/2013 heat waves.

The lower ranked patterns show variation in the early years of the NTP.
It would be interesting to compare these with the variation of survey effort in
that time.

## Creating a model
Pure speculation from here on, not much use without environmental explanatory variables.
Assuming linear correlation between Y and X, use redundancy analysis RDA.

```{r}
XSm <- as.matrix(XS)
XTm <- as.matrix(XT)
Y.rda <- rda(Y ~ XSm + XTm)
ordiplot(Y.rda)
```


# Simulate change
Stub section!

* Create a matrix X.sc1 of explanatory / environmental variables fo a change scenario.
* Y.expected = predict(model, X.sc1)
* Show Y.expected, compare to Y baseline.

# Discussion
This section contains expert knowledge provided by Bob Prince.

Note: Observations of tagged turtles have high value, record sightings where possible.

## Spatial patterns: maritime currents and coastal geomorphology
In summertime, a cooler counter-current comes up the Ningaloo shore;
the Leeuwin current running North to South shears off the coast at Jane's Bay.
Most Green Turtles nest north of Jane's Bay;
Loggerheads nest predominantly south of Pt Cloates / Jane's Bay where there's
the cooler counter current.
**Spatial patterns 3, 8 and 9*** coincide with offshore water temperature regime.

The remaining spatial patterns look like they possibly coincide with
geomorphology and geology of beaches, which determine the suitability of beaches for nesting.

## Candidate environmental drivers
* **SOI**
  Colin Limpus did a prediction linking SOI (southern oscillation index) to green
  turtle abundance. Does the SOI correlate to nest abundance?
* **Shallow water bathymetry**
  Turtles enter the lagoon through reef breaks, and nest directly onshore behind
  reef breaks if the beach is sufficiently sandy.
* **Beach orientation and wind exposure**
  Turtles don't like to be sandblasted while nesting, so they will favour low winds
  or sheltered beaches.
* **Beach geomporphology and geology**
  The ability to nest depends on the sand composition and state (moisture) on the beach.
  But not all sandy beaches are always sandy - at Jakobz / Wobiri, a cyclone in
  the 1990s washed what looked like a sandy beach
  off the rocky substrate, which made the beach inaccessible for turtles to nest.
* **Bathymetry**
  At low tide, some beaches might not be accessible to turtles, as the reef might
  be too exposed.
* **Seagrass**
  Sea climate and cyclone damage drive Seagrass productivity.
  Seagrass contains Zinc, which is an essential trace element.
  Does turtle abundance correlate to Zinc availability?

## Turtle phyisiology and life cycles
To model the abundance and variation of nesting, one has to understand the life cycle
of turtles, identify each step and mine possible drivers and impactors, then relate those
(minding the time lag of impact) to nesting.

Green turtles are herbivorous, Loggerhead turtles are carnivorous.
Nesting follos dietary surplus, diet of Loggerheads varies less than diet of Greens,
as it's buffered through the additional trophic level.

Green turtles start ovigenesis in April (offshore), and lay eggs in mid Nov to end of Jan.
Processes affecting turtle physiology in April (wherever they are at that time)
might affect / correlate with nesting.


## Next steps
Product: Further agglomerate data by summarising tracks / nests by turtle season
and either of division, section or subsection.

Question 1: Green turtle nesting abundance can vary in orders of magnitude between years.
Identify these low abundance years, compare to survey effort / environmental drivers.
Filter surveys of green turtle beaches to extermely low numbers of
green nests / tracks, see abundance of other species, compare sampling effort to other times

Question 2: Saturation sampling occurs when too many turtles trample tracks.
Flag high nest / track abundances as possible saturation sampling
